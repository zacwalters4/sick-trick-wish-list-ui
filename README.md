## Sick Trick Wish List - Frontend

This application was built with `create-react-app`.

### Set Up

Fork + clone down this repo.

Run `npm install` to install dependencies for the repo.

Run `npm start` to start up your React server.

Run `npm run cypress` to start up the Cypress testing server.

### Expectations / Rules

**Please, read the entirety of each iteration's description before starting to code that iteration's features. There are some helpful notes included**

Build an app for yr local sk8 rat to help them track their trick progression.

You will have 3 hours to build this application.

We do want to see good commit habits - atomic commits that log small, focused changesets. Don't worry about creating GitHub issues, though.

### Iteration 0

Pull down the [API repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/sick-trick-wish-list-api). Set up instructions are in that repository's README.

Do *not* nest this inside your front-end repository.

### Iteration 1

Get all existing tricks from the API on page load and display them on the DOM.


### Iteration 2

Create a controlled Form component to create a trick (look into the API documentation to see what pieces of information are expected, and what datatypes it wants each piece to be). As a user types into the input fields, the form component's state should change.  When the user clicks the `SEND IT` button, the application should update the App's state.  The new trick should display with all of the existing tricks. 

Notes:  
- The `Stance` select input should contain options 'Regular' and 'Switch'
- The `Obstacle` select input should contain options 'Flatground', 'Ledge', 'Rail', 'Stairs', and 'Pool'
- You do not need to worry about error handling!  
- Do not worry about making the POST request to the database yet.

### Iteration 3

Now that the functionality is there for adding a trick, write some tests:

**Be sure to intercept and stub any userflows that rely on data from the API**
* Write tests covering what should be displayed on the page when the user first visits.
* Write a test that checks that when data is put into the form, the value is reflected in that form input.
* Write a test to check the user flow of adding a new trick to the DOM.

### Iteration 4 (extension)

When the user makes a trick, the application should make a post request to the API. The new trick should still exist upon reloading the page.

Note:  
- Keep any fetch calls you write in the App component for now. If you have time to refactor your fetch calls into a separate helper file, that is fine, but it is *NOT* a requirement for this application.

### Iteration 5 (extension)

Delete a trick when the user clicks an `X` button.  The deletion should persist upon reloading the page.

### Other Extensions
* Add a counter for `Attempts` to each `Trick` card. User should be able to click an existing trick's `attempts` number. and increase the number representing how many times they've attemted this trick. 
* Try writing out a few other tests to cover sad path testing for your network requests.
